# AeonTales-AI

**Shape the past, influence the future** an AI-powered RPG with living NPCs, dynamic time travel, and evolving narrative.

---

## Project Overview

AeonTales-AI is an experimental role-playing game (RPG) that integrates AI/NLP/ML to make NPCs (“non-player characters”) who adapt, interact, and respond to player actions in meaningful ways. Key themes:

- **Time travel mechanic**: Player decisions in past states affect future game states.  
- **Living NPCs**: NPCs have memory, goals, and may evolve over time.  
- **Dynamic narrative**: Branching story elements, emergent behavior, possibly procedurally generated content.

## Status & Roadmap

**Current status**: In development / prototype stage. Some core systems created (NPC skeleton, time travel scaffold, narrative branching), but many features still pending.

**Planned features / milestones:**

| Milestone | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| NPC Memory & Goal-setting | Implementing internal state for NPCs so they remember interactions, change behavior over time. |
| Time Travel Engine | Ability to alter past decisions and propagate changes to future game states. |
| Dialogue & Narrative System | Branching dialogues, procedurally generated narrative content. |
| State Persistence / Save-Load | Save game / load game with all dynamic states. |
| User Interface / Visualization | Either simple CLI or basic UI to interact with game / NPCs. |
